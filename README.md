# Glucu

This is an Android app that retrieves and displays Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data for diabetic users. It retrieves data from the official [Dexcom API](https://developer.dexcom.com/home) and displays it using the [SciChart library](https://www.scichart.com/).

Compared to other apps out there, like [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/) (which was the best at the time), or even the modern Dexcom app, this app is useless, but it was a fun proof-of-concept and really jumpstarted my programming skills. It also led to me winning the WRHS 2019 Autonomous Learner Award.
